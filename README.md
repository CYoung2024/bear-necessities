# üêª Bear Necessities

App made by cadets, for cadets.

Includes:

- Accountability features like signing IFN, notifications for fire drills, etc.
-
-
- That's about it for now...

# üíª We're building additional apps!

Bear Necessities is intended to be a cross-platform app that cadets will visit on a daily basis, whether it's using their mobile devices or their laptops. In order to support this app, we need a couple of other apps as well.

## ‚≠ê OOD app

This web-only app allows OODs to check in on the accountability of their company, send messages without flooding everybody's emails, and react to a fire alarm efficiently.

## ‚≠ê RCDO app (eventually)

## ‚≠ê Mailroom app (maybe)

**Front-End:** React Native <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" title="React Native"><img src="https://github.com/get-icon/geticon/raw/master/icons/react.svg" alt="React Native" width="21px" height="21px"></a> / Javascript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" title="JavaScript"><img src="https://github.com/get-icon/geticon/raw/master/icons/javascript.svg" alt="JavaScript" width="21px" height="21px"></a>

- React Native is a JavaScript framework that uses native components to create mobile applications. It provides a bridge between JavaScript and the native platform APIs, allowing us to write code that is compiled into native code for both iOS and Android platforms. React Native also provides a set of built-in components that are platform-specific, which allows us to create native-looking applications with a single codebase.

**Back-end:** Azure <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us" title="Firebase"><img src="https://github.com/get-icon/geticon/raw/master/icons/azure.svg" alt="Azure" width="21px" height="21px"></a>

- Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform, offering a wide range of services and solutions for building, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of data centers. We are using an Azure SQL database with Azure Functions.

**Dev Tools:** Expo <a href="https://expo.io/" title="Expo"><img src="https://github.com/get-icon/geticon/raw/master/icons/expo.svg" alt="Expo" width="21px" height="21px"></a>

- Expo is a set of tools and services built on top of React Native that makes it easier to develop cross-platform mobile applications. It provides a set of pre-built UI components, as well as APIs for accessing native functionality like camera, location, and push notifications. Expo also includes a set of development tools that streamline the development process, including a live-reloading development server and an app-building service that simplifies the process of building and publishing apps to app stores.
